# Worklog

## 2026-10-31 — GitHub source integration
- Verified Rilan-Dev/personal-ai-assistant and cloned its initial main.
- Imported original Phase 1 TypeScript harness/UI/tests from archive.
- Integrated generated Expo SDK 58 native Android and iOS projects.
- Added restricted Kotlin PAADeviceControl app/camera Intents and package allowlist.
- Registered the native ReactPackage; removed unnecessary template Android permissions.
- Added deterministic native action planning, bridge adapter and regression coverage.
- Recorded unsupported AI, voice, accessibility and outbound actions as not implemented.
- Validation and push evidence to be appended when available.

### Verification
- Fresh npm ci: succeeded (490 packages installed; 13 dependency advisories, 2 high).
- npm test: 29/29 passed (harness, native planner and source wiring checks).
- npm run typecheck: passed for shared core and React Native app.
- npm run web:export: passed; Expo Metro generated a static web bundle.
- Android Kotlin compilation: NOT VERIFIED; Linux worker lacks Java JDK and Android SDK.
- iOS Xcode build and real Android physical-device testing: NOT VERIFIED.
- Owner-controlled native launch actions are intentionally disabled until the in-app grant is selected.

### GitHub Actions build infrastructure
- Initial Core tests workflow: SUCCESS on commit 00799b3.
- Initial Android workflow: FAILED before compilation at android-actions/setup-android@v3;
  GitHub Actions log shows obsolete SDK package "tools" unavailable.
- Replaced that setup action with direct SDK manager installation for API 36 and build-tools 36.0.0.
  Android Kotlin compilation remains unverified until a new workflow run reaches Gradle.

## 2026-10-31 — Phase 2 LangGraph planning adapter
- Reviewed upstream LangGraph.js main at 959f041dfb8f6bbafa6af3ebb4bc20484a9290da;
  Deep Agents.js at 26f190d40f44a2bb498db73e9e98b002bb8554fe.
- Added actual @langchain/langgraph StateGraph runtime for model -> policy steps.
- Reused @langchain/openai for schema-constrained provider adapters; server model
  credentials remain in environment (none committed).
- Added a planning-only bearer-authenticated HTTP API bound to loopback by default.
- Added strict server tool allowlist, Zod input checks, redacted observations,
  error sanitization and 32 KB request ceiling.
- Added mobile createRemotePlanner with HTTPS enforcement, timeout and client
  response validation; native chat UI requires explicit remote mode and does
  not persist bearer tokens to disk.
- Corrected Android CI: create ephemeral debug.keystore with keytool in runner
  before APK compilation; no key checked into Git.
- Local npm test: 48/48 passing with real LangGraph graph and simulated
  end-to-end HTTP model -> tool -> observation loop; npm run typecheck passed.
- Expo web static export passed. An actual LLM provider and physical-device
  acceptance remain unverified.
- Added a server/client action-to-user-intent gate: currently only exact supported single-step commands can trigger native app/camera operations; multi-step or unrelated commands fail closed.
- Android CI signing fix and GitHub verification pending commit.
