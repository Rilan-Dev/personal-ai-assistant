# Worklog

## 2026-10-31 — GitHub source integration
- Verified Rilan-Dev/personal-ai-assistant and cloned its initial main.
- Imported original Phase 1 TypeScript harness/UI/tests from archive.
- Integrated generated Expo SDK 58 native Android and iOS projects.
- Added restricted Kotlin PAADeviceControl app/camera Intents and package allowlist.
- Registered the native ReactPackage; removed unnecessary template Android permissions.
- Added deterministic native action planning, bridge adapter and regression coverage.
- Recorded unsupported AI, voice, accessibility and outbound actions as not implemented.
- Validation and push evidence to be appended when available.

### Verification
- Fresh npm ci: succeeded (490 packages installed; 13 dependency advisories, 2 high).
- npm test: 29/29 passed (harness, native planner and source wiring checks).
- npm run typecheck: passed for shared core and React Native app.
- npm run web:export: passed; Expo Metro generated a static web bundle.
- Android Kotlin compilation: NOT VERIFIED; Linux worker lacks Java JDK and Android SDK.
- iOS Xcode build and real Android physical-device testing: NOT VERIFIED.
- Owner-controlled native launch actions are intentionally disabled until the in-app grant is selected.

### GitHub Actions build infrastructure
- Initial Core tests workflow: SUCCESS on commit 00799b3.
- Initial Android workflow: FAILED before compilation at android-actions/setup-android@v3;
  GitHub Actions log shows obsolete SDK package "tools" unavailable.
- Replaced that setup action with direct SDK manager installation for API 36 and build-tools 36.0.0.
  Android Kotlin compilation remains unverified until a new workflow run reaches Gradle.
